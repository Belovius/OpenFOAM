OpenFOAM: Solvers & Cases
=========================

Solvers and cases made with the OpenFOAM Toolbox (some for my Master Thesis)
Doing version control with GitHub allows me to track my progress in developing a solver 
with OpenFOAM. 
The goal is to simulate PCMs taking account of temperature dependent viscosity. 
First step is to validate a solver called viscobbSimple.
